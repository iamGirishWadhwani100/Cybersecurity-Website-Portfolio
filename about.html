            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Girish Wadhwani. I’m originally from kota which is famous for its education, but have been living and studying in Udaipur for past three years pursuing B.Tech. in computer science and engineering from Geetanjali college.

            <p>
                I am particularly drawn to the challenges and intricacies of <b>Offensive Security</b>  and <b>Red Teaming</b>. Understanding how attackers think and operate is crucial for building robust defenses, and I enjoy the proactive approach of identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. My explorations also include **WiFi Security**, delving into its protocols and potential weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                My learning philosophy centers around hands-on experience. I believe in applying theoretical knowledge through practical projects and experimenting with tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, and Nmap within ethical boundaries and lab environments. This practical approach solidifies my understanding and hones my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside my college studies, I’m actively training in cybersecurity and ethical hacking at Grass Solutions where I’ve gained hands on experience in Metasploit, Linux, Networking and various hacking tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve also worked on a project called “Network Traffic Analyzer” focusing on analyzing network traffic to analyze security threats and optimize network performance. I’m eager to apply those skills to your company
